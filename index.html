	<p>Hi Everyone!  This is my <strong>VERY</strong> first ever webpage (built from good ol' fashioned HTML and CSS). Two things of which I've never knew about a few months ago. I can easily see how overwhelming and complex it can seem at first but then again, it's important to remind oneself that no mistake is ever permanent. I intend to continue to improve upon this site as I become more and more adept at website construction. Please stay tuned and thanks for visiting! :)</p>
	<p>Oh and I would also like to give a big shout out to all of the staff at RCB as they have been extremely encouraging and helpful throughout the program so far.</p>
